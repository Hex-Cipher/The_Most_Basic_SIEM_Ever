# The_Most_Basic_SIEM_Ever
So basically I tried making my own SIEM tool only using python

The regex patterns in this project are designed specifically for parsing logs in auth.log files in Kali Linux.

If you plan to use this SIEM tool on logs from other systems (e.g., CentOS, Windows), you will need to:

1-Adjust the regex patterns in the parser to match that systemâ€™s log format.

2-Update the log path.
